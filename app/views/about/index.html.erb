              Welcome to my ceramic etsy shop! My name is Gloria and I am a self-taught ceramicist throwing in Toronto & Thornhill, Ontario, Canada. I have 2 cats that give me inspiration for most of my pieces! I mainly make mugs and planters with hand carved designs. I hope you find something you like in my shop!
